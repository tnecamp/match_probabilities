	note={Also in Bradburn et. al (Singer included):  "...assuring respondents of absolute confidentiality had a small but consistent effect on willingness to answer individual questions. Nonresponse rates for sensitive questions were consistently and sometimes significantly lower when people were told that their replies would be held in confidence. Furthermore, there is at least the suggestion that a promise of confidentiality enhances the quality of response to the most sensitive items on the interview. Thus, if respondents can be assured of the confidentiality of their replies, responses to sensitive questions will benefit. But such assurances must be meaningful; they cannot be given lightly."}
